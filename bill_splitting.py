# TODO:
# * Implement the program as described in the comments at the top of the file.

# TODO (extra):
# * Change the program so that it additionally reports a breakdown of what each
#   person had to eat.
# * Change the program so that if it is called without arguments, a table of
#   how much everybody should pay is displayed

# TODO (extra-extra):
# * Use collections.defaultdict
# * Use sys.argv
